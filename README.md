# Exploratory Data Analysis on AirBNB Market Data

Analyze Raw Economic Data using Python

## Description
As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

There are three files in the data folder: airbnb_price.csv, airbnb_room_type.xlsx, airbnb_last_review.tsv.

###Objectives
* What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.
* How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.
* What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.
* Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed,   
  nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.
